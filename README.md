Hello, I'm Quentin Désiré, student in Computer Science at the University of Bordeaux.

Interested in computers in general I decided to code and expirement some creative things!

I code the most in Java, C/C++, Python and Web (both front and backend, mostly JS) but I'm totally open to learn more languages!

You can reach me via email at qtin97490@outlook.fr.
